# DocGenie
A document management system that allows users create documents, set access privileges for their documents, view other users' public and role-level documents, save private for-your-eyes-only documents and also edit or delete your saved documents.

### About the application

#### API Features

The following features make up the Document Management System API:

##### Authentication

* Uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.
* Generates a token upon successul login / account creation and returns it to the client.
* Verifies the token to ensures a user is authenticated to access some endpoints.

##### Users

* Allows users to be created.
* Allows users to login and obtain a token
* Allows authenticated users to retrieve and edit their information only.
* Ensures all users can be retrieved and modified by an admin user.

##### Roles

* Ensures that users have roles.
* Ensures user roles could be admin or regular.
* Ensures roles can be created, retrieved, updated and deleted by an admin user.
* Ensures a non-admin user cannot create, retrieve, modify, or delete roles.

##### Documents

* Allows new documents to be created by authenticated users.
* Ensures all documents have access roles defined as public or private.
* Allows admin users to create, retrieve, modify, and delete documents.
* Allows the admin user to retrieve all documents, except private documents.
* Allows documents to be retrieved by its owners.
* Ensures users can delete, and update documents that they own.
* Allows users to retrieve all documents they own.

##### Search

* It allows users to search public/role documents that belong to other users (as well as documents that belong to the user).
* It allows admin to search for a particular user.

##### API Documentation

The API has routes, each dedicated to a single task that uses HTTP response codes to indicate API status and error messages.
You can find the full API documentation here: <https://andela-mharuna.github.io/slate>

##### Authentication

* Users are assigned a token on signup or signin. This token is needed for subsequent HTTP requests to the API for authentication and can be attached as values to the header's x-access-token or authorization key. API requests made without authentication will fail with the status code `401: Unauthorized Access`.
